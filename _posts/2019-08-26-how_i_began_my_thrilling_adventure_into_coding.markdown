The love for coding is something that runs in my family. My oldest brother is a front-end web developer, my uncle is a digital marketer that owns his own company, and my youngest brother has just begun his journey at DePaul for software engineering. I was always interested in the work they did but didn't know if it was the right path for me. 

Since I did love technology but also loved art, I felt that a degree in digital multimedia design was the right path for me. While I loved working on the programs and enjoyed my classes, I felt like something was missing. In my last year at college, I finally took the web development classes. 

While I struggled at first, I have never had so much fun working on something. I found the coding process was interesting, challenging, and made me feel proud of the work I was making. For the first time I wasn't just designing sites, I was getting my hands dirty and creating them too. When the classes were over and I graduated, all I wanted to do was learn more about coding. 

They offered me a position at the school to be a tutor and I immediately took it. Through being a tutor I got to expand my knowledge of coding and jump into JavaScript on top of what I already knew from HTML and CSS. I was also taking as many lynda.com classes as I could in my spare time to try and teach myself as much about coding as possible. My family noticed how intrested I was in the coding aspect and suggested going to a bootcamp for software engineering. Flat Iron seemed like the perfect fit and this year I decided to dedicate myself to learn how to code. While the path isn't easy, I haven't felt this motivated to learning a subject in a long time and can't wait to see where this journey takes me.
